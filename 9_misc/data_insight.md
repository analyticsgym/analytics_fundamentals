# Data Insight?

**Data** and **insight** are both terms at the top of the corporate buzzword list. 

You might have heard phrases like “Company X is a big data insights company using machine learning, AI, and analytics to revolutionize Y”. 

All joking aside, when working on data insights projects, it’s critical to align team members and stakeholders on what true data insight represents. 

To start, how should we think about data?

Data = collected and stored information. 

Another way to think about data; [Airbnb describes data](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-democratizes-data-science-with-data-university-3eccc71e073a) as “the voice of our users at scale”.

So what is an insight?

**An insight = positioning information that is useful AND actionable for your stakeholder.**

If the information isn’t actionable, then it’s not an insight.

If the information is actionable but not useful, then it’s not an insight.

Both useful AND actionable criteria should pass to qualify as a data insight.
