#### Bonus reminder
- In a business setting, top visualizations often include a comparison reference. 
- Stakeholders are keen to know how X is doing compared to Y.
- Examples might include: expected vs. actual performance, performance vs. average baseline, pre vs post trends, comparison across business/customer segments, etc.
